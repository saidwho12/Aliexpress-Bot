    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
    the copyright owner that is granting the License.

    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
    exercising permissions granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following

/**
 * ElementHandle represents an in-page DOM element.
 *
 * @remarks
 * ElementHandles can be created with the {@link Page.$} method.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
 *
 * (async () => {
 *   const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
 *   const page = await browser.newPage();
 *   await page.goto('https://example.com');
 *   const hrefElement = await page.$('a');
 *   await hrefElement.click();
 *   // ...
 * })();
 * ```
 *
 * ElementHandle prevents the DOM element from being garbage-collected unless the
 * handle is {@link JSHandle.dispose | disposed}. ElementHandles are auto-disposed
 * when their origin frame gets navigated.
 *
 * ElementHandle instances can be used as arguments in {@link Page.$eval} and
 * {@link Page.evaluate} methods.
 *
 * If you're using TypeScript, ElementHandle takes a generic argument that
 * denotes the type of element the handle is holding within. For example, if you
 * have a handle to a `<select>` element, you can type it as
 * `ElementHandle<HTMLSelectElement>` and you get some nicer type checks.
 *
 * @public

/**
 * Represents a DOM frame.
 *
 * To understand frames, you can think of frames as `<iframe>` elements. Just
 * like iframes, frames can be nested, and when JavaScript is executed in a
 * frame, the JavaScript does not effect frames inside the ambient frame the
 * JavaScript executes in.
 *
 * @example
 * At any point in time, {@link Page | pages} expose their current frame
 * tree via the {@link Page.mainFrame} and {@link Frame.childFrames} methods.
 *
 * @example
 * An example of dumping frame tree:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
 *
 * (async () => {
 *   const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
 *   const page = await browser.newPage();
 *   await page.goto('https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html');
 *   dumpFrameTree(page.mainFrame(), '');
 *   await browser.close();
 *
 *   function dumpFrameTree(frame, indent) {
 *     console.log(indent + frame.url());
 *     for (const child of frame.childFrames()) {
 *       dumpFrameTree(child, indent + '  ');
 *     }
 *   }
 * })();
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * An example of getting text from an iframe element:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const frame = page.frames().find(frame => frame.name() === 'myframe');
 * const text = await frame.$eval('.selector', element => element.textContent);
 * console.log(text);
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * Frame lifecycles are controlled by three events that are all dispatched on
 * the parent {@link Frame.page | page}:
 *
 * - {@link PageEvent.FrameAttached}
 * - {@link PageEvent.FrameNavigated}
 * - {@link PageEvent.FrameDetached}
 *
 * @public

 * Keyboard provides an api for managing a virtual keyboard.
 * The high level api is {@link Keyboard."type"},
 * which takes raw characters and generates proper keydown, keypress/input,
 * and keyup events on your page.
 *
 * @remarks
 * For finer control, you can use {@link Keyboard.down},
 * {@link Keyboard.up}, and {@link Keyboard.sendCharacter}
 * to manually fire events as if they were generated from a real keyboard.
 *
 * On macOS, keyboard shortcuts like `⌘ A` -\> Select All do not work.
 * See {@link https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/1313 | #1313}.
 *
 * @example
 * An example of holding down `Shift` in order to select and delete some text:
 *
 * ```ts
 * await page.keyboard.type('Hello World!');
 * await page.keyboard.press('ArrowLeft');
 *
 * await page.keyboard.down('Shift');
 * for (let i = 0; i < ' World'.length; i++)
 *   await page.keyboard.press('ArrowLeft');
 * await page.keyboard.up('Shift');
 *
 * await page.keyboard.press('Backspace');
 * // Result text will end up saying 'Hello!'
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * An example of pressing `A`

 * The Mouse class operates in main-frame CSS pixels
 * relative to the top-left corner of the viewport.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Every `page` object has its own Mouse, accessible with {@link Page.mouse}.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Using ‘page.mouse’ to trace a 100x100 square.
 * await page.mouse.move(0, 0);
 * await page.mouse.down();
 * await page.mouse.move(0, 100);
 * await page.mouse.move(100, 100);
 * await page.mouse.move(100, 0);
 * await page.mouse.move(0, 0);
 * await page.mouse.up();
 * ```
 *
 * **Note**: The mouse events trigger synthetic `MouseEvent`s.
 * This means that it does not fully replicate the functionality of what a normal user
 * would be able to do with their mouse.
 *
 * For example, dragging and selecting text is not possible using `page.mouse`.
 * Instead, you can use the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentOrShadowRoot/getSelection | `DocumentOrShadowRoot.getSelection()`} functionality implemented in the platform.
 *
 * @example
 * For example, if you want to select all content between nodes:
 *
 * ```ts
 * await page.evaluate(
 *   (from, to) => {
 *     const selection = from.getRootNode().getSelection();
 *     const range = document.createRange();
 *     range.setStartBefore(from);
 *     range.setEndAfter(to);
 *     selection.removeAllRanges();
 *     selection.addRange(range);
 *   },
 *   fromJSHandle,
 *   toJSHandle
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * If you then would want to copy-paste your selection, you can use the clipboard api:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // The clipboard api does not allow you to copy, unless the tab is focused.
 * await page.bringToFront();
 * await page.evaluate(() => {
 *   // Copy the selected content to the clipboard
 *   document.execCommand('copy');
 *   // Obtain the content of the clipboard as a string
 *   return navigator.clipboard.readText();
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * **Note**: If you want access to the clipboard API,
 * you have to give it permission to do so:
 *
 * ```ts
 * await browser
 *   .defaultBrowserContext()
 *   .overridePermissions('<your origin>', [
 *     'clipboard-read',
 *     'clipboard-write',
 *   ]);
 * ```

 * Page provides methods to interact with a single tab or

 *
 * :::note
 *
 * One Browser instance might have multiple Page instances.
 *
 * :::
 *
 * @example
 * This example creates a page, navigates it to a URL, and then saves a screenshot:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';
 *
 * (async () => {
 *   const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
 *   const page = await browser.newPage();
 *   await page.goto('https://example.com');
 *   await page.screenshot({path: 'screenshot.png'});
 *   await browser.close();
 * })();
 * ```
 *
 * The Page class extends from Puppeteer's {@link EventEmitter} class and will
 * emit various events which are documented in the {@link PageEvent} enum.
 *
 * @example
 * This example logs a message for a single page `load` event:
 *
 * ```ts
 * page.once('load', () => console.log('Page loaded!'));
 * ```
 *
 * To unsubscribe from events use the {@link EventEmitter.off} method:
 *
 * ```ts
 * function logRequest(interceptedRequest) {
 *   console.log('A request was made:', interceptedRequest.url());
 * }
 * page.on('request', logRequest);
 * // Sometime later...
 * page.off('request', logRequest);

         *
         * The only difference between {@link Page.evaluate | page.evaluate} and
         * `page.evaluateHandle` is that `evaluateHandle` will return the value
         * wrapped in an in-page object.
         *
         * If the function passed to `page.evaluateHandle` returns a Promise, the
         * function will wait for the promise to resolve and return its value.
         *
         * You can pass a string instead of a function (although functions are
         * recommended as they are easier to debug and use with TypeScript):
         *
         * @example
         *
         * ```ts
         * const aHandle = await page.evaluateHandle('document');
         * ```
         *
         * @example
         * {@link JSHandle} instances can be passed as arguments to the `pageFunction`:
         *
         * ```ts
         * const aHandle = await page.evaluateHandle(() => document.body);
         * const resultHandle = await page.evaluateHandle(
         *   body => body.innerHTML,
         *   aHandle
         * );
         * console.log(await resultHandle.jsonValue());
         * await resultHandle.dispose();
         * ```
         *
         * Most of the time this function returns a {@link JSHandle},
         * but if `pageFunction` returns a reference to an element,
         * you instead get an {@link ElementHandle} back:
         *
         * @example
         *
         * ```ts
         * const button = await page.evaluateHandle(() =>
         *   document.querySelector('button')
         * );
         * // can call `click` because `button` is an `ElementHandle`
         * await button.click();
         * ```
         *
         * The TypeScript definitions assume that `evaluateHandle` returns
         * a `JSHandle`, but if you know it's going to return an
         * `ElementHandle`, pass it as the generic argument:
         *
         * ```ts
         * const button = await page.evaluateHandle<ElementHandle>(...);
         * ```
         *

         * @remarks
         *
         * If no element is found matching `selector`, the method will throw an error.
         *
         * If `pageFunction` returns a promise `$eval` will wait for the promise to
         * resolve and then return its value.
         *
         * @example
         *

         * const html = await page.$eval('.main-container', el => el.outerHTML);
         * ```
         *
         * If you are using TypeScript, you may have to provide an explicit type to the
         * first argument of the `pageFunction`.
         * By default it is typed as `Element`, but you may need to provide a more
         * specific sub-type:
         *
         * @example
         *
         * ```ts
         * // if you don't provide HTMLInputElement here, TS will error

         * ```

         * // The compiler can infer the return type in this case, but if it can't

         *
         * @remarks
         * This method is a shortcut for calling two methods:
         * {@link Page.setUserAgent} and {@link Page.setViewport}.
         *
         * This method will resize the page. A lot of websites don't expect phones to
         * change size, so you should emulate before navigating to the page.
         *
         * @example
         *
         * ```ts
         * import {KnownDevices} from 'puppeteer';

         * If the function passed to `page.evaluate` returns a Promise, the

         * generic the type of `pageFunction`:
         *
         * ```ts
         * const aHandle = await page.evaluate(() => 2);
         * ```
         *
         * @example
         *
         * {@link ElementHandle} instances (including {@link JSHandle}s) can be passed
         * as arguments to the `pageFunction`:
         *
         * ```ts
         * const bodyHandle = await page.$('body');
         * const html = await page.evaluate(body => body.innerHTML, bodyHandle);
         * await bodyHandle.dispose();
         * ```

     *
     * Unlike {@link ExecutionContext.evaluate | evaluate}, this method returns a
     * handle to the result of the function.
     *
     * This method may be better suited if the object cannot be serialized (e.g.
     * `Map`) and requires further manipulation.
     *
     * @example
     *
     * ```ts
     * const context = await page.mainFrame().executionContext();
     * const handle: JSHandle<typeof globalThis> = await context.evaluateHandle(
     *   () => Promise.resolve(self)
     * );

     * @example
     * A string can also be passed in instead of a function.
     *
     * ```ts
     * const handle: JSHandle<number> = await context.evaluateHandle('1 + 2');
     * ```
     *
     * @example
     * Handles can also be passed as `args`. They resolve to their referenced object:
     *
     * ```ts
     * const bodyHandle: ElementHandle<HTMLBodyElement> =
     *   await context.evaluateHandle(() => {
     *     return document.body;

     * const stringHandle: JSHandle<string> = await context.evaluateHandle(
     *   body => body.innerHTML,
     *   body
     * );
     * console.log(await stringHandle.jsonValue()); // prints body's innerHTML
     * // Always dispose your garbage! :)
     * await bodyHandle.dispose();
     * await stringHandle.dispose();
     * ```
     *
     * @param pageFunction - The function to evaluate.
     * @param args - Additional arguments to pass into the function.
     * @returns A {@link JSHandle | handle} to the result of evaluating the
